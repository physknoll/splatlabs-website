## What Makes PortalCam Revolutionary

### The Problem with Traditional Cameras

Standard cameras — even 360° cameras — capture **flat pixels**. They create static images from fixed viewpoints that require extensive stitching, editing, and processing. The result is a 2D representation that viewers can look at but never truly explore.

### The PortalCam Solution

PortalCam captures **light fields** — the actual way light travels through space. This fundamental difference means:

| Traditional Cameras | PortalCam |
|--------------------|-----------|
| Capture pixels (flat images) | Captures light fields |
| 2D representation | Full 3D spatial data |
| Requires stitching and editing | Automatic processing |
| Static viewpoints | Navigable, walkable 3D worlds |
| Hours of post-processing | Results in minutes |
