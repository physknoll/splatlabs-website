## What Makes Lixel L2 Pro Revolutionary

### The Problem with Traditional SLAM Scanners

Traditional handheld SLAM devices require extensive post-processing to achieve usable results. You scan in the field, then wait hours or days for software to process the data before you can use it. This delays projects, creates bottlenecks, and increases costs.

### The L2 Pro Solution: Zero Post-Processing

The Lixel L2 Pro delivers **real-time point cloud data that rivals post-processed quality** — no waiting, instantly ready for use.

| Traditional SLAM | Lixel L2 Pro |
|------------------|--------------|
| Hours of post-processing required | Real-time usable output |
| Basic colorization | Photo-quality true-color point clouds |
| Standard point density | 1 million points/m² with 1mm spacing |
| Variable accuracy | 3cm absolute accuracy |
| Requires powerful workstation | Process on mobile device |
| Limited environment support | Works indoors, underground, tunnels |
